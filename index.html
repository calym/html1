			<h1>This is an h1 inside the header!</h1>
			<p>
				Right now it is <time>11:00</time>. (This was just to use the time tag, but it doesn't look like anything special.)
			</p>
			<nav>
				This is inside a nav tag. It's supposed to be for groups of links to help get around on a site, so here are some fake ones just to pretend. <br>
				<a href="stuff">stuff</a>
				<a href="morestuff">morestuff</a>
				<a href="evenmorestuff">otherstuff</a>
			</nav> 
		</header>

		<p>
			This is a paragraph. I'm gonna try to put a script inside this paragraph.
			<br>
				<script>
				document.write("Hello World!")
				</script>
			<br>	
			Here's a link to my <a href="http://www.calymcmorrow.com">website</a>,
			and a completely unrelated image. Though penguins are cool. <br>
			<img src="penguins.jpg" alt="Penguins!">
		</p>

		<h2>This is an h2!</h2>
		
		<p> 
			This paragraph under h2 has some <em>emphasized text</em> because it's important.<br>
			<strong>This text is strong!</strong> <br> 
		</p>

		<p>
			<del>This text is inside the del tag.</del> <br>
			<ins>This text is inside the ins tag.</ins> It's just underlined though, which is a little confusing.
		</p>
		
		<hr> 
		<p id = "practice">An hr tag makes this nice line to separate parts of a page. This underline and capitalization are done with css.</p> 

		<p id = "spacing">
			This paragraph exists just to play with spacing and has its own css ID.

		<h3>Here's an h3. Yay.</h3>

		<div id = "box2">
		</div>
		
		<div id = "box1">
			This text is inside a div. This doesn't really do anything special without some css, but because of css it's in a green box!
		</div>

		

		<div id = "box3">
			This text is inside a div. This doesn't really do anything special without some css, but because of css it's in a red box!
		</div>

		<div id = "box4">
			Box 4, for practicing abs position properties.
		</div>
		
		<div id = "box5">
			Box 5, for practicing abs position properties.
		</div>
		
		<div id = "box6">
			Box 6, for practicing abs position properties.
		</div>

		<div id = "box7">
			I'm box 7! I'm invisible!
		</div>

		
		<div id = "align">
			Vertical alignment! And penguins! <img src="penguins.jpg" alt="penguins">
		</div>							

		<br>

		<span>
			This text is inside a span. It also doesn't really do anything special without some css. We learned in class today that the difference between a span and a div is that a div is a block level element, which takes up 100% of the width and has a big effect on document flow, and span is inline.
		</span>

		<section>
			<h4>This is an h4 inside a section tag!</h4>
			<p>
				This is a paragraph inside the section. It feels very similar to div and span.
			</p>
		</section>

		<article>
			<h5>This is an h5 inside an article tag!</h5>
			<p>
				According to W3 Schools, the article tag "specifies independent, self-contained content." 
			</p>
			
			<aside>Examples include blog posts or news stories. </aside> <br>

			(That last sentence is inside an aside tag, but it doesn't look any different. This text is just inside the article tag.)
		</article>

		<blockquote>
			I'm not totally certain how an article is different from a blockquote, but here's a bunch of quoted text: <br>
			When you launch  the camera app, it’s automatically setting white balance, exposure level, a tone map, setting autofocus matrix metering, and takes multiple photos and picks the sharpest. It has a new flash as well, called the “True Tone Flash.” Normally when you take a flash photo, ambient light in a room varies. Some lights are cooler, some are warmer. The flash will clash with the lighting in the room and make things look unnatural. The iPhone 5S corrects for this. It has two flashes, a cooler one and an amber one. That makes for over 1,000 unique flash variations for your photos. This is a world’s first for any camera, Schiller says. As someone who looks like a vampire in flash photos taken in low lighting, I’m excited to check out how this works out.

		<q>That is a  level of graphics performance you’ve never before seen on a mobile device</q> This is inside the q tag. 
		
		<br>

		<cite>
			It’s Apple’s Big Day: Get Ready for a Ton of New Stuff, wired.com
		</cite> 
		That text was in the cite tag.

		<h6>This is an h6 tag. It's so wee!</h6>

		<p>
			The abbr tag is for acronyms and abbreviations, and the global title attricute can be used to show the full version of the acronym when you mouse over it. I'm gonna put <abbr>WFTDA</abbr> inside that tag. It stands for the Women's Flat Track Derby Association.

		This is an unordered list of some snacks at refactorU:
		<ul>
			<li>bagels</li>
			<li>muffins</li>
			<li>coffee</li>
			<li>almonds</li>
		</ul>

		This is an ordered list of some snacks at refactorU, though the point is kind of lost since I styled the ordered list to use images for the bullets, and that took away the numbering.

		<ol>
			<li>bagels</li>
			<li>muffins</li>
			<li>coffee</li>
			<li>almonds</li>
		</ol>

		This is a description list of some snacks at refactorU:

		<dl>
			<dt>bagels</dt>
				<dd>delicious bread product. Put cream cheese on it.</dd>
			<dt>muffins</dt>
				 <dd>pastry in a paper cup.</dd>
			<dt>coffee</dt>
				 <dd>Hot black bitter beverage.</dd> 
			<dt>almonds</dt>
				 <dd>nuts! High in calcium.</dd>
